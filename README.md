## 📖 Project Overview  

Urbanization and industrialization have placed increasing stress on aquatic ecosystems. This project analyzes urban water quality dynamics by leveraging long-term monitoring data and advanced statistical techniques.  

The dashboard highlights:  
- ⏳ Changes over time in key water quality parameters  
- 🗺️ Geospatial patterns across watersheds and monitoring sites  
- 📉 Statistical insights from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering  
- 🔄 Generalizable workflows applicable to other urban regions
