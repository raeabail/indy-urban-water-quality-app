# Indianapolis Urban Water Quality Trends Dashboard  

An interactive dashboard for exploring **spatiotemporal trends in urban surface water quality across Indiana**, with a focus on 24 years of monitoring data from Indianapolis. This tool combines statistical analysis, geospatial mapping, and interactive visualization to make long-term water quality data accessible to researchers, policymakers, and the public.

## Project Overview  

Urbanization and industrialization have placed increasing stress on aquatic ecosystems. This project analyzes urban water quality dynamics by leveraging long-term monitoring data from Indianapolis, Indiana, as a lens for understanding broader trends across urban environments.  

The dashboard highlights:  
- Changes over time in key water quality parameters  
- Geospatial patterns across watersheds and monitoring sites  
- Statistical insights from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering  
- Generalizable workflows that can be applied to other urban regions  

---

## Features  

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Time series plots, heatmaps, and spatial maps  
- **Multivariate Analysis**: PCA, clustering, and loadings to identify dominant pollutants  
- **Geospatial Mapping**: Watershed-based mapping with interactive filters  
- **Reproducible Methods**: Code and workflows designed for adaptation to new datasets  
- **Web-Based Interface**: Accessible through GitHub Pages or local hosting

## Data Sources  

- **Indianapolis Monitoring Data**: 24 years of surface water quality measurements  
- **Watershed Boundaries**: Used to contextualize site-level observations  
- **Pollutant Parameters**: Includes nutrients, metals, bacteria, and physical-chemical indicators  

*(Note: Add dataset links if available)*

## Tech Stack  

- **Languages**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
- **Editor**: Visual Studio Code (with Live Server extension recommended)  
- **Mapping**: Leaflet / Mapbox / ArcGIS integration for geospatial data  
- **Visualization**: D3.js, Chart.js, Plotly (depending on module)  

---

## Example Outputs
The dashboard provides:
- Interactive PCA biplots to explore relationships between pollutants
- Temporal trend lines for parameters such as nitrogen, phosphorus, E. coli, and metals
- Spatial visualizations of watershed health across Indianapolis
