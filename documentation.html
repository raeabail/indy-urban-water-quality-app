        <h2 id="intro-h">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Amidst accelerated urbanization and industrialization, an imperative to protect and enhance water quality has emerged as a critical concern within environmental frameworks and global health. This increased attention is attributable to water's integral role in supporting ecological systems, agricultural productivity, industrial processes, and human health (Bashir et al., 2020). Urban expansion, accompanied by infrastructure developments and increased population densities, imposes substantial stress on aquatic ecosystems through the introduction of pollutants from industrial effluents, sewage emissions, and agricultural runoff laden with pesticides and fertilizers (Abowel and Sikoki 2005; Ekubo and Abowel 2011; Bashir et al., 2020). These contaminants not only undermine the integrity of aquatic environments but also diminish the quality of potable water, thereby elevating public health risks (Morris 1999; Bashir et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>Increased urbanization impacts water quality management by disrupting natural hydrological processes. The replacement of permeable ground with impermeable materials such as concrete and asphalt amplifies runoff, potentially overwhelming municipal drainage systems and facilitating the direct influx of untreated water into rivers and lakes (Larsen et al., 2016). This urban runoff transports a diverse array of pollutants, including heavy metals, pathogens, and microplastics, exacerbating threats to aquatic biodiversity and human health (Larsen et al., 2016). Environmental data can play a crucial role in evaluating water quality and the health of ecosystems. Regular monitoring of water quality includes measuring various parameters like dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus (Mohammed et al., 2022). These measurements may differ based on the specific needs of the area, the methods used, the sample size, and the objectives of the project (Mohammed et al., 2022).</p>
        <p>For example, a study that assessed water quality by measuring variables like nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, alkalinity, hardness, turbidity, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and pH, to derive the Water Quality Index (WQI) (Uddin et al., 2021). Techniques from multivariate statistics, particularly Principal Component Analysis (PCA), have been used to help interpret field data, allowing for a reduction in the complexity of the data while preserving its original structure (Shrestha and Kazama, 2022). Moreover, the use of other statistical methods including cluster analysis, discriminant analysis, and ANOVA provides deeper insights into the intricacies of water quality data. These methods facilitate the recognition of underlying factors influencing the water system, offering an effective means for managing water resources and promptly addressing pollution issues (Boyacioglu and Boyacioglu, 2008; Chen et al., 2011).</p>
        <p>Longitudinal monitoring initiatives are essential for recognizing temporal alterations in water quality, pinpointing sources of contamination, and evaluating the efficacy of pollution mitigation efforts (Larsen et al., 2016; Girmay et al. 2020). Additionally, such data are instrumental in crafting predictive models that can inform forthcoming water management tactics and policy frameworks (Larsen et al., 2016; Shah et al. 2021). However, the implementation of effective water quality monitoring and management can be challenging, given financial limitations, logistical obstacles, and the need for specialized instrumentation and expertise (Kirschke et al., 2020). Water quality monitoring involves sampling and analyzing water constituents like chemicals, sediments, and biological indicators to assess the health of water bodies (Lee and Riskin, 2021). This process is essential for detecting pollution problems, designing remediation programs, and ensuring compliance with regulations (Lee and Riskin, 2021). The complexity arises from the multitude of agencies involved in monitoring, including state agencies, tribes, local governments, and federal entities like the EPA and USGS (Behmel et al., 2016; Lee and Riskin, 2021). These agencies conduct monitoring programs, administer grants, provide technical guidance, and conduct compliance monitoring to ensure water safety and environmental health (Behmel et al., 2016; Lee and Riskin, 2021). Additionally, private entities such as universities, watershed associations, and environmental groups also contribute to water quality monitoring efforts (Behmel et al., 2016; Lee and Riskin, 2021). The involvement of multiple agencies introduces challenges related to coordination, data sharing, resource allocation, and ensuring consistency in monitoring practices across different jurisdictions and organizations.</p>
        <p>Marion County, Indiana, has conducted water quality monitoring programs for several decades. This study leverages the data gathered by the Marion County Public Health Department (MCPHD), conducting a comprehensive analysis of local water quality trends. The department's surface water monitoring program has expanded over time to include 54 sites, testing for a range of parameters, such as heavy metals and nutrients. By examining this extensive dataset, some stretching back to 1995, this study aims to understand the impacts of urban development, agricultural practices, and policy interventions on water quality. Furthermore, this analysis serves a dual purpose: it not only provides valuable insights into the specific water quality issues facing Marion County but also investigates how water quality parameters change at different sampling sites, allowing the determination of which parameters are most responsible for the variations in water quality.</p>

        <h3 id="study-area">Study Area Description</h3>
        <p>Marion County, IN lies in the central part of the state, facilitating access from various regions. The county was incorporated into the city limits of Indianapolis in 1970, so the geographic footprint of the two are identical. The county encompasses a mix of developed and natural landscapes, including parks, rivers, and a portion of the White River running through Indianapolis, offering opportunities for environmental and ecological studies. It is included in the largest watershed in the state of Indiana known as the Upper White River Watershed (Bowling et al., 2018). Overall, the topography is flat to undulating, with an average slope of about 1.0 percent (Bowling et al., 2018). The soils are mainly productive soils, for example alfisols, developed in glacial till, and the primary agricultural crops are corn and soybean, along with other crops such as wheat, oats, barley, and sorghum (Bowling et al., 2018).</p>

        <h3 id="water-sampling">Water Sampling</h3>
        <p>There are three waterways labelled in Figure 1: Eagle Creek (yellow), Fall Creek (red), and the Lower White River (blue). For this study, each waterway is considered a site, where Eagle Creek is Site 1, Fall Creek is Site 2, and the Lower White River is Site 3. The Lower White River samples from smaller waterways that lead into the White River (orange). The smaller waterways include Pogue's Run, Pleasant Run, Lick Creek, and Bean Creek (blue). All waterways enter into the White River in the southwest part of the county.</p>

        <p>MCPHD started publishing sampling data in 1995. There are a total of 54 sites that are sampled. Five times a month the following parameters are tested: pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, specific conductivity, and total dissolved solids. Quarterly, the following parameters are tested: heavy metals, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, chloride, sulfate, and E. coli.</p>
        <p>To investigate similarities and differences within and between sites, 24 years of raw water quality data were downloaded from the MCPHD website and analyzed for sites across Marion County, IN.</p>

        <h3 id="data-prep">1. Data Preparation</h3>
        <p>To ensure uniformity across datasets from the three sites, data were centered and scaled. Kaiser Meyer Olkin and Bartlett tests were applied to assess suitability for PCA. Variables failing adequacy thresholds were omitted. Pearson correlation analysis (alpha 0.05) was used to assess linear relationships with 95 percent confidence intervals.</p>

        <h3 id="pca">2. Principal Component Analysis</h3>
        <p>PCA was used to reduce dimensionality and identify orthogonal components that capture variance in the data. Components were retained based on eigenvalues greater than 1 and aided by scree plot inspection, followed by rotation for interpretability.</p>

        <h3 id="varimax">3. Dominant Water Quality Parameters</h3>
        <p>Varimax rotation was used to simplify factor loadings. Loadings above 0.75 are considered strong, 0.50 to 0.75 moderate, and 0.30 to 0.50 weak.</p>

        <h3 id="kmeans">4. K-means Clustering</h3>
        <p>Normalized parameters were clustered with K-means. The average silhouette method determined optimal k. Clusters were interpreted with respect to geography and land use context.</p>

        <h3 id="lda">5. Linear Discriminant Analysis</h3>
        <p>LDA validated K-means clusters and created low dimensional projections that maximize separation between cluster centroids. Accuracy was evaluated with training and cross validation results.</p>

        <h2 id="discussion-h">Discussion</h2>
        <p>The comprehensive study of water quality in Marion County, Indiana, conducted an in depth analysis revealing significant spatial variability in parameters such as heavy metals, nutrients, and microbial indicators across Sites 1, 2 and 3, attributable to various anthropogenic activities and natural processes. Key findings highlighted fluctuations in levels of arsenic, phosphate, chloride, and E. coli, each tied to different sources and carrying implications for water resource management. These findings align with established literature noting urbanization and agricultural runoff as pivotal factors impacting water quality. The results further validate the hypothesis that localized land use practices, especially in areas close to intensive farming operations, significantly affect water quality. Elevated phosphate levels, primarily due to fertilizer runoff, exemplify the predominant source of phosphorus affecting the region, underscoring the complex interplay between land use patterns and water quality outcomes.</p>
        <p>However, the variance in water quality parameters within each site underscores the influence of localized environmental factors and pollution sources, despite overarching similarities in urban development and land use across these sites. Notably, the lack of significant fluctuation within each site points to the possible effectiveness of existing water management strategies and natural resilience of these water bodies. Table 11 displays key findings for each site.</p>

        <p>While this study centers on Indianapolis, the methods and insights are broadly applicable to urban environments facing similar stressors, including aging infrastructure, mixed land use, and legacy industrial pollution. The dominance of chloride from road salts, phosphate from agriculture, and heavy metals like chromium and lead mirrors findings in other Midwestern cities, which reinforces the importance of long term monitoring and integrated watershed management strategies for urban water quality planning.</p>
        <p>The clustering results revealing relative stability within sub watersheds, despite external urban pressures, are consistent with findings from longitudinal studies in other urban rivers. Therefore, this study's approach and insights can inform urban watershed assessments globally.</p>
